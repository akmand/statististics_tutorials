    "# Experimental Design Tutorial: Testing Conversion Rates\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we perform a hypothesis test comparing the conversion rates of two mortgage products, new versus existing, using an experimental design rather than observational data. In our controlled experiment, we would like to find out if the new product significantly outperforms the existing one:\n",
    "- **New Product:** Offers innovative elements like flexible payment options, tailored interest rates, and a digital dashboard.\n",
    "- **Existing Product:** Offers a traditional, reliable fixed payment structure and an established application process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we assume 400 borrowers randomly are assigned equally to two groups. To further enhance the robustness of our experimental design and minimise confounding effects, we can incorporate **stratified randomisation**. For instance, if age is a critical factor that might influence conversion rates, we could first stratify borrowers into relevant age groups (e.g., below 40 and 40 or older) and then randomly assign an equal number from each stratum to both groups. This ensures that each group has a similar age distribution, thereby controlling for any age-related differences in conversion behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This random assignment minimises confounding variables and allows us to isolate the effect of product features on conversion rates, enabling us to directly assess if the new product significantly outperforms the existing one, as opposed to the correlational insights typically derived from observational studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work through each step using made-up numbers and perform the analysis using Python."

    "\n",
    "Experimental designs, like the one in this notebook, have key advantages over observational data when it comes to establishing causal relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Control Over Confounding Variables:** In an experiment, borrowers are randomly assigned to treatment groups. This randomisation helps ensure that confounding factors (e.g., demographic characteristics, prior financial experiences) are evenly distributed across groups, reducing their impact on the results. In observational studies, these confounders might be unevenly distributed, which can bias the conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Causal Inference:** Because experimental designs actively manipulate the treatment (in this case, exposure to different mortgage products) under controlled conditions, they provide stronger evidence for cause-and-effect relationships. Observational data typically only reveal associations, making it difficult to determine whether a change in the mortgage product truly causes a difference in conversion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "While observational data can be useful for identifying patterns and correlations, experimental designs offer a more robust framework for determining causality by controlling for biases and confounding variables."

    "1. **Random Assignment:** Ensures an unbiased distribution of borrowers between the groups, minimising confounding.\n",

    "1. **Z-Test for Proportions:** A robust method to compare conversion rates between two independent groups.\n",
    "1. **Confounding Variables:** Always consider external factors that might affect results. Even with randomisation, borrower characteristics, presentation methods, and external influences may introduce bias.\n",
    "1. **Interpretation:** Rejecting the null hypothesis implies that the new product's conversion rate is significantly higher at the chosen significance level ($\\alpha = 0.05$)."
